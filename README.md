## Introduction ##
#### What is this? ####
EasyJection is an easy-to-use Dependency Injection (DI) Framework for *C#(.Net)* and *Unity* projects.<br/>
The framework implements dependency injection **without** using attributes. Such an implementation avoids tying your project code with the code of the framework itself and you can start using the framework without manipulating any part of your project code.
> *Since when the attributes (as well as the namespace) are used in your project's class code, that class, at least indirectly, begins to know about where it gets its dependency from.*

This project is open source.

#### Why use this? ####
If you're familiar with dependency injection and see how EasyJection could help your project, check out the set-up and [features](#features) to see more. If not, read on:

Dependency injection is an intimidating word for a simple concept you're likely familiar with. It simply means if ObjectA creates ObjectB, then ObjectA resolves all of ObjectsB's dependencies (i.e. fields & properties).
